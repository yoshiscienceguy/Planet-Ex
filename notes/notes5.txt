Mission Objective #5 Notes
Tuesday, August 30, 2022
1. This is learning how to code!!
2. For now, its perfect. 
3. I was thinking I could do something with saving mission files, but thats entirely done when the students finish their projects. 
4. Its best for them to just save it into this folder and have that stored on the USB so everything is saved.
